# swrpg [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/CalebQ42/go-rpg/Profiles/StarWars?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/CalebQ42/go-rpg/Profiles/StarWars)
An extension of go-rpg specifically for the Star Wars RPG.

#Species
When creating a character you can just put in a string of the species instead of having to manually put in the stats. Stats, XP, and skills are automatically done, but other, more amorphous, species abilities can't be added (for now). Talents are also not added. Currently species from the three core rulebooks are supported but species from the source books should be coming.

  Bothan
  Droids - Obviously make sure you edit the stats and Skills
  Duros
  Gran - Remember to give one rank in either Charm or Negotiation
  Human - Remember to add the two non-career skills
  Ithorian
  Mon Calamari
  Sullustan
  Gand - If you select the lung Gand remember the extra 10 XP
  Rodian
  Trandoshan
  Twi'lek - Remember to give one rank in either Charm or Deception
  Wookiee
  Cerean
  Kel Dor
  Mirialan
  Nautolan
  Togruta
  Zabrak
